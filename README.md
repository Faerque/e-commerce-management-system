# 🛒 E-Commerce Management System (Educational Edition)

This project simulates a simplified backend system of an e-commerce platform designed to teach **advanced object-oriented programming (OOP)** and **MVC-style architecture** using pure Python.

---

## 📚 Project Purpose

This system is built who want to:

- Deepen their understanding of **OOP principles**.
- Learn how to structure code using a **controller-like architecture** (similar to MVC).
- Understand how real-world systems like **shopping carts, orders, users, and payments** are modeled.
